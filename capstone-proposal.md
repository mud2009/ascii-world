Name of Student: Will Greenberg

Name of Project: ASCII world

Project's Purpose or Goal:

ASCII world will be a web application for user's to upload images to be converted into ASCII art and displayed in a feed of images for others to see.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

The MVP for this project is to have a SPA that displays at least one image that has been converted to an ASCII image.

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? 

I will use React for the creation of the SPA, JavaScript and possibly additional libraries for the conversion of the images, and then NoSQL to handle the storage of the images, posts, and potentially user data.

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here:

I would like to set up functionality for authorization/authentication, as well as comments and likes for other user's posts. I would like to try hosting the site in some capacity perhaps with Firebase. Additionally I would like to work on a mobile application if I have enough time. Hopefully the mobile application would have the ability to use the phone's camera to do ASCII conversions. Additionally, I am interested in using Google's cloud vision API to analyze the uploaded images and create captions based off of the machine learning interpretations of the image.

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

For the stretch goal of the automated captions, I will have to learn how to use Google's cloud vision API.

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

Nothing at this time!
